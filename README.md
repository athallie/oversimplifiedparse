# Over simplified parser

#### What is the program for?
This was a pico project for my final assignment of logic programming in first year mechanical engineering. But now, this program is used as a beginner project based C++ learning. I'm still at the very tip of C++, so this project is a big deal for me. I expect the program to be completed within a reasonable amount of time. Lastly, I want to say that everyone is welcome to contribute.
#### How the program works (simplified)
1. The program takes input from the user
2. The input will be parsed by parser function in the program
3. Each of the parsed value will be stored in the proper array
4. The program will the calculate the highest value, lowest value, and average value of each class through the relevant functions
5. The program will also calculate the highest and lowest value between all classes through another functions
6. The program then shows the values as well as the names and grades from each class through output functions
7. The program ends
#### Improvement Plan
1. Dynamically create x numbers of array (or vector) based on user demand
2. Format the data into a table
3. Generate a summary of the results
4. Generate a bar chart of the results for the summary
5. Feature to save the table and the summary as a pdf file
6. Provide a simple and lighweight GUI
7. Provide better instructions
8. Better error handling
