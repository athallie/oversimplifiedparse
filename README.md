# Over simplified parser
## @eavelie

#### What is the program for?
1. This is a pico project for my final assignment of logic programming in first year mechanical engineering.
2. This program puts to practice my understanding on basic data manipulation, basic array manipulation, basic error handling, fundamentals of function, and control flow.
#### How the program works (simplified)
1. The program takes input from the user
2. The input will be parsed by parser function in the program
3. Each of the parsed value will be stored in the proper array
4. The program will the calculate the highest value, lowest value, and average value of each class through the relevant functions
5. The program will also calculate the highest and lowest value between all classes through another functions
6. The program then shows the values as well as the names and grades from each class through output functions
7. The program ends
